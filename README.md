# 50 Days, 50 AI Automations üöÄ

Hey! I'm Sai Akhil, AI/ML Developing Engineer and I got tired of doing the same repetitive tasks every damn day. So I'm building 50 AI-powered automations in 50 days using n8n.

Why? Because I'm lazy and I'd rather spend an hour automating something than 5 minutes doing it repeatedly for the rest of my life.

## What's This About?

I'm documenting my journey of building real-world automations that actually save time. No fancy corporate solutions - just practical stuff that makes life easier.

Each automation:
- Solves a real problem I (or others) face
- Uses free/cheap tools only
- Includes the full n8n workflow JSON
- Has actual results (time saved, efficiency gained)

## The Automations So Far

### ‚úÖ Day 1: Smart Email Classifier
**Problem:** Drowning in emails, missing important stuff  
**Solution:** AI reads emails, identifies urgency, stars important ones, drafts responses  
**Time Saved:** 2+ hours daily

### ‚úÖ Day 2: Social Media Multi-Poster  
**Problem:** Rewriting the same post for LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook  
**Solution:** Write once, AI adapts for each platform's vibe  
**Time Saved:** 20-30 mins per post

### üîÑ Day 3: Coming Soon...
(Check back tomorrow!)

## Want to Use These?

1. Install n8n locally (it's free): `npm install n8n -g`
2. Grab the workflow JSON from any day's folder
3. Import into n8n
4. Add your credentials (Gmail, OpenAI, etc.)
5. Done! Customize as needed

## Tools I'm Using

- **n8n** - The workflow automation tool (self-hosted = free)
- **OpenAI API** - For the AI magic (costs pennies per workflow)
- **Google Sheets** - For storing data (free)
- **Various free APIs** - Whatever each automation needs

## Got Ideas?

I need 48 more automations! If you have repetitive tasks that annoy you, drop an issue or hit me up. Might build your idea next!

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need coding skills?**  
A: Nope! That's the whole point. Just copy-paste and configure.

**Q: How much does this cost?**  
A: n8n is free (self-hosted). OpenAI API costs like $0.01-0.05 per automation run.

**Q: Can I use these for my business?**  
A: Hell yeah! That's why I'm sharing them.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Open an issue. I'll help when I can.

## The Real Goal

Look, we're all wasting time on stupid repetitive tasks. If even one of these automations saves you an hour per week, that's 52 hours per year. That's a whole work week you get back.

Let's automate the boring stuff and focus on what matters.
